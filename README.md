# javaMp3Player
This VocaloidPlayer is a simple Java GUI application I created to help learn JavaFX in Java 8.
This version just has basic features, but later I'd like to add more advanced ones to create
a more userfriendly experience. Enjoy.

08/19/16: This version has a new feature where it scans the Resources folder for songs and background images instead of recieving them from user input at the shell. I also removed the pause button to make room for a button to cycle through background images from the resources folder. In the next update, I'll try to make the UI more pleasing to the eye, and add some extra functionalities to some of the buttons to save space.
